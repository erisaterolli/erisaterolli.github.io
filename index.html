								<li>Main Organizes of Programming Camp with Google.
								<br />
								For two days together with Computer Engineering Department of Epoka University we organized the Google Programming Camp with high school students that were interested in Computer Sciences. Students from Tirana, Durres, Elbasan, Fier, Gramsh were selected from their school directors to participate in this program. In two days they had chance to experience the complete university student life including Epoka campus life, teaching process in the computer labs and of course the out-of-town Epoka-unique transport. The program was financially supported by technology giant Google that takes similar initiatives to serve directly to the community.  In the opening ceremony Mrs. Milena Harito, who during her term in office as the Minister of Innovation and Public Administration led a digital transformation of the public administration to ensure a higher efficiency and transparency, emphasized that one of the biggest challenges in modernization of our country, public and also private sector, is to find high-qualified people to understand the way towards the modernization. The Head of the Section of Natural and Technical Sciences at the Albanian Academy of Sciences, Professor Salvatore Bushati expressed his joy to be together with the future academics, appreciated the activity and encouraged the participants to continue their studies in Computer Science. The executive director of National Agency of Scientific Research and Innovation Mr. Geron Kamberi added that students in engineering need a good blend of both technical and soft skills in order to be successful. Through a Skype call connection, Dr. Silvio (Google researcher) talked to students on the importance of computer science and technical fields. Through real examples from his experience as a scientist, he did a great talk about the culture, challenges and opportunities that big tech companies offer to their current and future employees. Finally, in a Q&A session Silvio answered many interesting questions coming from the high school students.  The training days were organized with different training sections where students were able to learn the main concepts of programing. In the second day of the program, teams composed of three randomly selected students competed on an online programming competition. There were three winning groups in this online competition, for each winning group were given certificates and  awards. The first place was shared between Jovan Shandro (Turgut Ozal Durres), Riselda Kodra (Naim Frasheri), Fidelius Lula (Ismail Qemali); Andi Hamolli (Sami Frasheri), Pranvera Progni (Qemal Stafa) and Armena Keshi (Mehmet Akif Vajza) got the the second place; Alban Louis Ziko (Harry Fultz Institute), Stela Leka (Dhaskal Todri) and Egnantis Basha (Flatrat e Dijes) got the third place. We thank the participating students and hope that they continue to build on the knowledge that they gained in this intensive camp.

									<li>I am co founder of <a href="mecodeprogram.com">me.code()</a> program.<br /> Me.Code() program was born as part of the Google Anita Borg Scholarship outreach for 2015 for the scholars in Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Our goal is to help high school students discover computer science through an AppInventor tutorial. Onsite workshops will take place in Albania, Bulgaria and Spain and the tutorial can also be followed online in 6 different languages.

										Main Organizer of Anita Borg Birthday Celebration in Albania 2016 <br />
										Anita Borg Birthday Celebration in Albania was a unique event organized for the first time in Tirana, Albania which lasted for an entire week. The events’ primary goal was the motivation and encouragement of girls in Computer Science or any related field to define high goals in life and to never give up pursuing their dreams. The event was devised in two parts. The first part consisted in a series of Android App development workshops which had as main target the high school female students. The goal here was to introduce them to the beauties and possibilities offered in computer science in a practical approach: by teaching them how to build their first Android App in an easy and interactive way. The Android App development workshops were held throughout 3 days in 3 high schools of Albania. A total number of 158 participants (124 females and 34 males) learned how to build their first Android App using the MIT App Inventor.
										<br />
										The second part of Anita Borg Birthday Celebration in Albania was a seminar for all girls studying in Computer Science or any related technical field. A total of 79 people, from whom 75 females and 4 males, were present and participated in it.The seminar remained faithful to the events’ primary goal; that is motivation and encouragement of girls to take action and pursue their dreams and consisted of various talks from invited guests, Minister of Innovation Mrs. Milena Harito and Google SE Mrs. Vedrana Jankovic, information about opportunities provided worldwide in the form of scholarships, internships, conferences, seminars or summer schools from universities and giants of technology.
